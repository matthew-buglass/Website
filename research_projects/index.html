                        Over the past few decades, data analytics have become more and more present 
                        and important in professional sport. This software's aim is to open up those
                        possibilities to the world of professional Curling in Canada.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Compiling data from <a href="https://stats.curling.io/">Curling Canada's</a> database,
                        the software allows users to customize their data set by selecting different attributes
                        from the game, such as player shot percentages, line scores, final scores, time remaining,
                        and hammer possetions. These attributes can be combined using mathmatical and logical
                        functions, allowing for almost limitless analysis opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once a data set has been created, it is cleaned and exported as a csv file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Current work is being done to give users the ability to customize neural network models
                        that can be trained on the same custom data sets.

                    <p>
                        In our Total Quality Management class at the Edward's School of Business, 
                        we were assigned a project to choose a company in Saskatoon and research their 
                        processes. Being university students who used public transport almost daily,
                        we decided to research the <a href="https://transit.saskatoon.ca/">Saskatoon Transit's</a> 
                        bus system, focusing on route 17 Stonebridge-University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using reports provided to us by Saskatoon Transit, interviews with Saskatoon Transit, 
                        and stop data obtained through Saskatoon Transit's public GTFS Realtime application 
                        programming interface (API). We investigated the bus system's efficiency based on 
                        how late or early busses arrived based on their scheduled arrival time (ie. timeliness).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We found that Saskatoon Transit's timeliness was highly varied, however, we could not 
                        wholly attribute periods when busses were running late or early to any particular 
                        stop or time of day because the spikes (either early or late) didn't always correspond 
                        with periods of high traffic or after specific stops. Our principal recommendation is 
                        that data be collected whenever busses pass a stop in addition to physically stopping. 
                        This will lead to a more consistent data set and would lead to more definitive findings.
