        "details": "'JDC West is the most prestigious undergraduate business competition in Western Canada, hosting 1,300 attendees and uniting over 650 delegates from twelve premier post-secondary institutions each year. Over the course of three days, students from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba showcase their skills in the academic, athletic, debate, and social aspects of the competition.'(<a href='https://www.jdcwest.org/'>www.jdcwest.org/</a>)<br><br> As the VP Technology, I organized and oversaw all IT aspects of the competition. My Director and I maintained the competiton website, automated delegate and judge registration, automated competition scoring, co-ordinated competition streaming, and maintained a competition app for delegates and attendees. The Saskatoon 2023 competition was the first one to be in person since the COVID19 pandemic and the first competition to be 100% livestreamed to YouTube, enabling friends, family, and colleagues to support their teams, even if they couldn't be in person in Saskatoon."
